Hi! Welcome to capstone 2 repository

Here, you will review and evaluate the data analysis of the dataframe with the title:
**The Shift in World's Energy Mix: Carbon Emissions from Conventional to Renewable Sources, 1962 - 2022**

Overview =

The world’s energy demand continues to rise, while the environmental impacts follow a linear trend. In the other hand, oil crisis in 70's century lead europe to find teh replacement of the energy sources. In an effort to meet this growing demand while reducing emissions, companies are investing heavily in renewable energy generation. It remains a learning curve—one that is still ongoing and continuously developing.

The questions is = ' ‘Does the usage of renewable energy really decrease the gas emissions?’

Time frame = 1962 - 2022 (the last 6 decade)
Big overview -> energy emission trend from 1962 - 2022 where fossil vs renewable

- Q1. Annual Convention Energy Carbon Emission 
    - How is the correlation between a country's convention energy and its annual carbon emissions the last 6 decades?
- Q2. Annual Renewable Energy Emission
    - What is the correlation between a country's renewable energy and its annual emissions the last 6 decades?
- Gas Emission Trend
    - How is the proportion of gas emission type and countries who produce the emission globally?
- GDP and Population Relation to Energy Consumption?
    - How do economic factors, like GDP, correlate with CO2 emissions in countries?
- Convention Energy vs Renewable Energy
    - How is the trend between convention energy consumption with renwable energy consumption?
